"""Multi-Agent Supervisor Workflow using LangGraph.

Implements a supervisor-orchestrated multi-agent architecture where a central
supervisor LLM dynamically routes tasks between researcher, analyst, and writer
agents based on the current state of the workflow.

Architecture:
    supervisor → researcher → supervisor → analyst → supervisor → writer → END

Unlike the linear multi_agent.py, this pattern allows the supervisor to:
    - Decide agent order dynamically based on task completion state
    - Re-route to an agent if its output is insufficient
    - Short-circuit steps if they are not needed for a given task
